title: Week 1 2.2 - 8.2
---

This week I was assigned to do the gitlab setup and start the architecture. Setting up the gitlab was a simple task and did not take very much time. 

For the architectural task I created some empty classes to show the structure of the project, created a UML diagram and wrote a short document to eplain the methods in the UML diagram.

I spent about one and a half hours this week on the project. 

The Monday meeting this week was cancelled and they will start next week.

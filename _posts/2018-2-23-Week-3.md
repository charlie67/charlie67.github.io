title: Week 3 16.2 - 23.2
---

This week I was assigned more of the backened code task specifically the adjacency problem. This turned out to be way simplier than I thought 
anded up just being a somewhat simple if statement. 

I spent about 12 hours on the project this week, this bring my total time up to 28.5 hours.

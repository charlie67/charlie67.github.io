title: Week 7 17.3 - 23.3
---

This week I was assigned the task of continuing UI work and work on design documnets, I've already done most of my design doc work 
so I only made small minor changes and wrote a component diagram.

I attended the document review on Tuesday and checked over the document.

For the UI I made a change to the high score system so if no high scores have been set then it displays no available high scores 

I have spent 7 hours on the group project this week which brings my total time up to 72 hours.

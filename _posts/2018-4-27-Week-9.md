title: Week 9 21.4 - 27.4
---

This week I looked at making Junit tests for the backend and created a few basic ones to see how they worked.

A lot of my time this week was spent on my robotics assignment so I couldn't do that much work on the group project.

I have spent 3 hours on the group project this week which brings my total time up to 95 hours.

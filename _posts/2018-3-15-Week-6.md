title: Week 6 9.3 - 16.3
---

This week I was assigned the task of UI work and intergrating with Ada's cube code. I finished most of the scenes and 
intergrated with Ada's code successfully. There is now a working prototype of the game, I also fixed a few potential bugs and 
identified some more that I need to be fixed.

I also wrote the design documents for the GUI code and we reviewed them on Monday, I have fixed the issues that were identified.

I have spent 14 hours on the group project this week which brings my total time up to 62 hours.

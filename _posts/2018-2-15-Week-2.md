title: Week 2 9.2 - 15.2
---
Our Monday meeting went ahead with 5 of our members, we discussed what we had done since Friday.

Last week I was assigned to carry on the architecture task. For this I started writing some of the simple code, this led to 
me changing and enhancing the design. 

I spent 10 hours on the project this week, this brings my total time up to 11.5 hours.

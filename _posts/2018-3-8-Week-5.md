title: Week 5 3.3 - 9.3
---

Last week our Friday meeting was cancelled due to the snow so we met on Tuesday instead, during this meeting I was assigned to carry on with the GUI and add a feature to the backend that I missed.

I added the feature to the backend and have completed two more screens on the GUI.

I have spent 10.5 hours on the project this week which takes my total time up to 47 hours
